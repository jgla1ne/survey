### Relationship Connection & Trust Questionnaire

**Purpose:**  
This questionnaire is intended to help both of us reflect on where we stand in terms of trust, emotional connection, and our vision for the future. There are no “right” or “wrong” answers—only honest expressions of how you feel right now.

**Instructions:**  
For each question, please select the response that best describes your current feelings. (You might consider keeping this confidential until we’re both ready to talk about the results.)  
- **Option A:** I see potential for a future together (romantically and/or deeply connected emotionally).  
- **Option B:** I feel deeply hurt and/or disconnected, and I struggle to see beyond the issues (for example, lingering concerns about behaviors that hurt our relationship).  
- **Option C:** I value our relationship as it stands now—especially as co-parents and friends—and I’m not pursuing a romantic reconnection.

**1. Vision for Our Future**  
How do you see our relationship evolving?  
- **A:** I believe rebuilding trust can lead to a renewed, intimate future together.  
- **B:** I feel too hurt, and certain behaviors have created a barrier I may not overcome.  
- **C:** I envision us remaining supportive friends and committed co-parents without a romantic element.

**2. Trust and Vulnerability**  
How comfortable do you feel opening up and being vulnerable with me?  
- **A:** I feel safe enough to share my innermost thoughts, hopeful for a deeper bond.  
- **B:** I’m guarded because past hurts make it difficult to trust you again.  
- **C:** I can talk to you when needed, though I see our connection primarily as cooperative rather than intimate.

**3. Emotional Impact of Past Conflicts**  
When thinking about past conflicts, what best describes your feelings?  
- **A:** I see them as challenges we can work through together to build a stronger foundation.  
- **B:** They’re reminders of behavior I still struggle to move past, affecting my trust.  
- **C:** I view them as important lessons that define our adult, practical relationship.

**4. Readiness to Work on the Relationship**  
Considering our separation, how open are you to efforts (such as counseling) to heal emotionally and rebuild trust?  
- **A:** I’m very open to working together for a future together.  
- **B:** I’m not sure I can heal from the past; my feelings are too painful right now.  
- **C:** I’m willing to engage in practical steps that help us collaborate better as co-parents and friends.

**5. Perception of Personal Change**  
How do you see the possibility of personal change (in either of us) influencing our relationship?  
- **A:** I believe that changes—in behavior, mindset, or circumstances—could pave the way for a renewed bond.  
- **B:** I’m skeptical that significant change will occur given the patterns of behavior I’ve observed.  
- **C:** I see the potential for respectful personal improvement that supports our partnership as friends and parents.

**6. Communication Quality**  
How would you rate the quality of our communication now?  
- **A:** I feel our communication has the potential to improve into a deeper, more supportive dialogue.  
- **B:** Our communication still feels strained and painful, reinforcing my distrust.  
- **C:** I consider our exchanges functional, which is enough for cooperation as partners in parenting.

**7. Emotional Safety**  
Do you feel emotionally safe around me?  
- **A:** Yes—I feel that we can create a space of mutual respect and understanding that might lead to an intimate partnership.  
- **B:** No—I still experience emotional risks that make it hard to feel safe.  
- **C:** I feel safe enough for constructive dialogue, but I perceive our relationship as a stable, non-romantic partnership.

**8. Co-Parenting Dynamics**  
How do you feel about our ability to collaborate effectively for the well-being of our children?  
- **A:** I believe that healing our emotional connection will also enrich our co-parenting.  
- **B:** The unresolved issues hinder my ability to fully trust you as a partner in parenting.  
- **C:** I’m confident that we can maintain a respectful, cooperative relationship strictly for our children’s benefit.

**9. Desire for Intimacy**  
How would you describe your current desire for emotional or physical intimacy with me?

**10. Overall Relationship Outlook**  
Taking everything into account, how would you summarize your feelings about our relationship’s potential?

- **B:** I’m deeply conflicted and uncertain if our issues can be overcome.  
- **C:** I value our current dynamic as friends and co-parents, without the desire to rekindle a romantic connection.

**Final Note:**  
This questionnaire is meant to facilitate honest self-reflection. It might serve as a conversation starter if you both are open to discussing where you stand and what (if any) future is possible. It may also be useful to consider professional guidance (such as counseling) when exploring these complex feelings.  

Use or modify this template as needed to best fit your circumstances. Good luck!
