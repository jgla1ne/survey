  <h1>Relationship Connection & Trust Questionnaire</h1>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This questionnaire is intended to help both of us reflect on where we stand in terms of trust, emotional connection, and our vision for the future. There are no “right” or “wrong” answers—only honest expressions of how you feel right now.</p>
  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> For each question, please select the response that best describes your current feelings.</p>
